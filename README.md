# KiiT-Agentic-AI
Contains code to make AI agents for KIIT


Currently `bonafide-agnet` checkes my emails for emails with subject [BONAFIDE], downloads them, sends it to an LLM to get the Name & Roll-Num and then check a database if the student exists. If the student exists then generate a PDF and <to be implemented> email the student back.
