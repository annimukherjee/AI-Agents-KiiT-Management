**Note:**  Some course names are listed without a specific course code.  The "Open Elective-II" entry lacks a course name.  The provided text does not offer a way to resolve this missing information.  Also, branch specifics (CSE, IT, CSCE, CSSE) have been omitted from the table for brevity and to avoid redundancy since the course code usually implies the branch.
